						<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">For years, machine learning, or learning from examples, has advanced artificial intelligence (AI)
											to build systems capable of generating models from data or sensor signals without direct
											instruction. As data are becoming rapidly available in all fields, learning-enabled systems, which
											have embedded learning components in the core, are becoming increasingly popular and
											powerful in industry and our daily lives. Indeed, learning has the advantage of examining a large
											quantify of data to find subtle features, which are often beyond human’s capabilities and
											limitations. Nevertheless, as learning algorithms are often driven by overly simplified objective
											functions (or optimization goals) and the data collected for learning are frequently biased,
											incomplete, or even hazardous, the transition of relying on machine leaning models for decision making is potentially risky. This is mainly attributed to the facts that existing learning algorithms
											or models are very limited in terms of their adaptability to changing environments, reliability in
											handling unfamiliar or unknown circumstances, and responsibility of making decisions.
						</p>

						<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The first international workshop on Adaptable, Reliable, and Responsible Learning (ARRL)
												provides a venue to bring together researchers and practitioners to report recent advancement in
												addressing the three key aspects of learning: adaptability, reliability, and responsibility. The
												purpose is to investigate theoretical foundations, algorithm designs, and frameworks to ensure
												that our future learning-enabled systems to be adaptable: the learning is adaptive to changing
												environments and task requirements; reliable: the learning can provide statistical guarantees
												when being used in the field; and responsible: the learning is fair, explainable, and trustable.
						</p>

						<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">We invite submissions that focus on recent advances in research/development of adaptable,
										reliable, and responsible (ARR) learning algorithms and designs. We also welcome papers
										discussing resources or software packages developed to tackle the ARR challenges, if the
										submissions have significant value to benefit others in the community.
						</p>

						<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Thus, there is a rising and urgent need towards Sustainable AI for both AI research and industry. Specifically, for sustainability of AI, we aim to reduce carbon emissions and huge computing power consumption, as well as addressing AI-related ethical issues,
						via developing advanced AI technology. This workshop aims to prompt state-of-the-art approaches on sustainable AI research, and also propagate data/resource-efficient methods and possible applications in the Sustainability domain. For example, submissions that are at the intersection
						of data mining and society like use of AI and data mining for ensuring affordable and clean energy and motivating climate/climate-change related action will be particularly welcome. The organizers invite researchers to participate and submit their research papers in the Sustainable AI Workshop.
